"""Reduce a model by removing/merging reactions that cannot carry flux.

Individual reduction modes (each removes a specific class of reaction, in place):

* ``remove_zero_interval_reactions`` — reactions locked at zero flux (``lb == ub == 0``);
  RAVEN ``simplifyModel`` ``deleteZeroInterval``.
* ``remove_dead_end_reactions`` — reactions touching a *topological* dead-end metabolite
  (one that, given reaction directions, can only be produced or only consumed, or
  participates in a single reaction); RAVEN ``deleteInaccessible``. Iterates to a fixpoint
  and prunes orphaned metabolites.
* ``remove_no_flux_reactions`` — reactions that cannot carry flux in *any* steady state,
  found by FVA (both min and max flux zero); RAVEN ``deleteMinMax``. Catches blocked
  reactions that are not topological dead-ends.
* ``remove_duplicate_reactions`` — all-but-one of each set of reactions with identical
  stoichiometry/bounds; RAVEN ``deleteDuplicates`` (detection-only: ``find_duplicate_reactions``).
* ``constrain_reversible_reactions`` — does not remove reactions; tightens bounds, making
  reversible reactions that can only carry flux one way irreversible (via FVA); RAVEN
  ``constrainReversible``.
* ``group_linear_reactions`` — lossy fold of single-producer/single-consumer chains into
  one reaction (drops gene rules); RAVEN ``mergeLinear``.

``simplify_model`` composes the above via RAVEN's ``simplifyModel`` boolean-flag interface,
applying the selected modes in RAVEN's order. ``remove_dead_end_reactions`` and
``remove_no_flux_reactions`` are complementary: the first is a cheap topological sweep, the
second an exact FVA-based sweep that also removes flux-blocked reactions the first misses.
