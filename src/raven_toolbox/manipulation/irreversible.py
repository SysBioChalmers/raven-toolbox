    """Split every reversible reaction into a forward + reverse pair.
    For each reaction with ``lb < 0``, including exchange (boundary)
    reactions -- MATLAB's ``convertToIrrev`` does not special-case them,
    so neither does this:

    - The original reaction is kept as the forward direction. Its
      lower bound is clamped to 0.
    - A new reaction with the same ID plus a ``_REV`` suffix is added,
      representing the reverse direction. Its stoichiometry is the
      negation of the original, its bounds are ``(0, -original_lb)``,
      and it inherits the name (with " (reversible)" appended), the
      gene-protein rule, the subsystem, the annotations and the notes
      of the original. MATLAB's ``convertToIrrev`` copies the same
      per-reaction fields across (``eccodes``, ``rxnMiriams``,
      ``subSystems``, ``rxnNotes``, ...); dropping them would, among
      other things, leave the reverse reaction without an EC code and
      so without a kcat downstream.
    - If the original reaction's objective coefficient is negative, it
      is moved onto the new reverse reaction (sign-flipped positive)
      and zeroed on the forward reaction, so a reversible reaction
      credited under the objective for *reverse*-direction flux still
      gets that credit after splitting. A non-negative coefficient is
      left on the forward reaction unchanged, and the reverse reaction's
      is left at its default (0) -- matching MATLAB's ``convertToIrrev``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        A cobra.Model, mutated in place.

    Returns
    -------
    list of str
        Sorted IDs of newly added reverse reactions (the ones ending in
        ``_REV``). The forward reactions retain their original IDs.
