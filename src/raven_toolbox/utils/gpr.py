"""GPR (gene-protein-reaction rule) linting.

Flag GPRs that are *not* in disjunctive normal form ("OR of AND-complexes"), via cobra's
GPR AST. GPR syntax *normalisation* is already done by cobra on assignment, so it isn't
re-implemented here.

Part (2) has no cobrapy equivalent and is ported here, reworked onto cobra's
GPR AST instead of RAVEN's brittle substring search. The relevant property is
**disjunctive normal form (DNF)**: an OR of AND-clauses of single genes, e.g.
``(G1 and G2) or G3``. Rules where an AND contains an OR — e.g.
``(G1 or G2) and (G3 or G4)`` — are *valid* for cobra but ambiguous for the
isoenzyme/complex reasoning used across RAVEN/GECKO, and ``expand_model``
(see :mod:`raven_toolbox.manipulation.expand`) only does something for DNF rules.
:func:`find_non_dnf_grrules` surfaces them as structured data rather than, as
RAVEN did, only printing a warning.
