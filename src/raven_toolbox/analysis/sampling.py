"""Random-objective flux sampling — RAVEN's ``randomSampling`` (port + improvements).

Samples the flux solution space by the **random-objective** method of Bordel et al.
(2010, PLoS Comput Biol, doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000859), as ported from RAVEN's
``randomSampling``: each sample maximises a small random linear combination of
reactions, so every sample is an *extreme point* (vertex) of the flux polytope.

This is a different statistical object from cobrapy's ``cobra.sampling`` (OptGP /
ACHR), which draw a (near-)uniform Markov-chain sample of the polytope *interior*.
Use cobra's samplers when you need the uniform flux distribution; use this when you
want a fast, robust spread of diverse optimal states — the workflow RAVEN uses to
compare conditions, and one that stays well-behaved on large or tightly-constrained
models where MCMC mixing is poor. cobrapy has no equivalent, so this is a genuine
addition, not a wrapper.

Improvements over RAVEN (see IMPROVEMENTS SAMP1):

* **`good_reactions` via one FVA pass**, not a hand-rolled per-reaction ``parfor``
  loop. A reaction is usable as a random objective if it can carry flux and is not
  stuck in a stoichiometrically-infeasible loop (its range blows past the arbitrary
  large bound). ``cobra``'s FVA computes exactly that, faster and in far less code,
  and can optionally be made ``loopless``.
* **Reproducible** via ``seed`` (RAVEN has no seed control).
* **`n_objectives` is a parameter** (RAVEN hard-codes 2, though its docstring claims
  3).
* **Tidy output**: a ``samples`` DataFrame shaped samples × reactions (matching
  ``cobra.sampling``), plus the reusable ``good_reactions`` list — instead of a
  reactions × samples matrix and a parallel index vector.

    Dispatches on ``method``:

    * ``"achr"`` (default) — Artificially Centered Hit-and-Run; near-uniform MCMC
      sampling of the polytope interior (wraps :class:`cobra.sampling.ACHRSampler`).
    * ``"chrr"`` — Coordinate Hit-and-Run with Rounding; near-uniform MCMC with
      maximum-volume-ellipsoid rounding, for better mixing on thin/ill-conditioned
      polytopes such as enzyme-constrained models.
    * ``"random_objective"`` — the random-objective vertex method of Bordel et al.
      (2010): each sample maximises a small random objective, returning a polytope
      vertex.

    The ``"achr"``/``"chrr"`` methods draw the (near-)uniform interior distribution;
    ``"random_objective"`` draws diverse vertices. Set any constraints you want to
    condition on (e.g. a biomass lower bound, measured fluxes, enzyme-usage bounds)
    on the model before calling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_samples:
        Number of flux vectors to return.
    method:
        ``"achr"`` (default), ``"chrr"``, or ``"random_objective"``.
    seed:
        Seed for reproducible chains/draws.
    thinning:
        ``achr``/``chrr`` — Markov-chain steps between recorded samples (default 100).
        The default is calibrated for small models (~200–500 reactions). On genome-scale
        models (>2000 reactions) lag-1 autocorrelation remains high even at thinning=100
        (measured: 0.926 on yeast-GEM with 4102 reactions), giving roughly 12 effective
        samples from 300 stored samples (ESS ≈ n × (1−ρ)/(1+ρ)). Independent chains at
        these default settings also frequently fail to agree with each other: on
        yeast-GEM, the *median* reaction fails the Gelman-Rubin R-hat>1.1 convergence
        threshold across 4 independent chains (67.5% of reactions fail it; 96.5% fail
        the stricter R-hat>1.01). Treat default-settings genome-scale output as
        unconverged for most reactions, not a caveat for a minority of hard ones. For
        genome-scale analyses either increase thinning substantially (≥1000), increase
        n_samples to compensate, try ``method='chrr'`` (raven-toolbox's rounding-based
        alternative, not wired into ACHR), or use an ESS/R-hat diagnostic to assess
        sample quality (see the `sampling convergence calibration study
        <https://github.com/edkerk/raven-docs/blob/main/docs/parameter-tuning/studies/sampling-convergence-calibration.md>`_
        on raven-docs).
    warmup:
        ``chrr`` — burn-in steps discarded before the first recorded sample.
    fixed_width_tol:
        ``chrr`` — a reaction whose FVA range is narrower than this is folded into
        the equality system as fixed (keeps the reduced polytope full-dimensional).
    n_objectives, good_reactions, loopless_good_reactions, exclude_reactions, max_attempts, suppress_errors:
        ``random_objective`` only — see the method's parameters; ``good_reactions``
        can be passed back from a previous result to skip the one-off FVA.
    replace_max_bound:
        ``random_objective`` only — replace the largest finite bound with infinity
        before sampling, so a reaction whose biological maximum exceeds the
        model's arbitrary cap isn't pinned there. Off by default.
    min_flux:
        ``random_objective`` only — re-solve each sample parsimoniously to
        minimise total flux at the optimum, squeezing residual loop flux out.
    n_proc:
        ``random_objective`` only — worker processes for drawing samples in
        parallel (each sample is an independent LP solve). Defaults to
        ``cobra.Configuration().processes``; set to 1 to sample serially.
        Reproducible for a given ``seed`` regardless of ``n_proc`` — each
        sample draws from its own independent RNG stream spawned from
        ``seed``, not from one continuously-advancing generator, so results
        no longer match pre-parallelization output for the same seed value.

    sign per reaction, as in RAVEN). The resulting flux vector is one sample.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_samples
        Number of flux vectors to return.
    n_objectives
        Reactions combined into each random objective (RAVEN's fixed 2).
    good_reactions
        Reaction ids eligible as objectives. If ``None`` they are computed once with
        :func:`find_good_reactions` and returned for reuse.
    replace_max_bound
        RAVEN's ``replaceBoundsWithInf``: replace the largest upper bound with
        ``+inf`` (and the smallest negative lower bound with ``-inf``) before
        sampling, so a reaction whose biological maximum exceeds the model's
        arbitrary cap is not pinned at it. **Off by default** — unlike RAVEN. It
        applies only to the sampling phase (``good_reactions`` is always found on
        the finite bounds), and it can open unbounded directions through loops
        that show up as large fluxes in non-objective reactions; pair it with
        ``min_flux`` if you enable it.
    min_flux
        After maximising the random objective, re-solve parsimoniously
        (:func:`cobra.flux_analysis.pfba`) to minimise total flux at that optimum —
        squeezes residual loops out of each individual sample.
    loopless_good_reactions, exclude_reactions
        Forwarded to :func:`find_good_reactions` when it is invoked (loopless loop
        detection is on by default).
    max_attempts, suppress_errors
        A sample is retried if the random objective is degenerate (zero flux). After
        ``max_attempts`` failures this raises, unless ``suppress_errors`` (then the
        degenerate solution is kept with a warning).
    seed
        Seed for reproducible objective draws. Sample ``i`` always draws from
        the ``i``-th child stream of ``numpy.random.SeedSequence(seed)``,
        independent of every other sample and of ``n_proc`` — so a given seed
        reproduces the same samples whether drawn serially or in parallel.
    n_proc
        Worker processes for drawing samples in parallel. Defaults to
        ``cobra.Configuration().processes``; set to 1 to sample serially in
        this process. Each sample is an independent LP solve (a fresh random
        objective, then optimize), so this parallelises via
        ``cobra.util.ProcessPool`` — the same pool cobrapy's own
        ``flux_variability_analysis``/``single_reaction_deletion`` use.
