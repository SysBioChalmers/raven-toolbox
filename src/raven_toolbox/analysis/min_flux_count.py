"""Minimum-cardinality flux distribution — port of RAVEN's ``getMinNrFluxes``.

Finds a flux distribution satisfying the model's steady state and bounds that
activates as *few* reactions as possible (optionally weighted per reaction),
via a big-M MILP. This is a different, harder problem than pFBA
(:func:`cobra.flux_analysis.pfba`), which minimizes the *sum* of flux
magnitudes rather than the *count* of nonzero fluxes — cobrapy has no
built-in equivalent.

Two disclosed simplifications relative to ``getMinNrFluxes.m``, neither of
which changes the MILP actually being solved (see the source read that
motivated them: MATLAB's own MILP never references ``model.c``, the
objective — only its own *preliminary* scale-estimating solve does):

- **No irreversible-splitting.** MATLAB's COBRA-toolbox solvers require an
  irreversible model, so a reversible reaction becomes two split reactions,
  each with its own binary indicator. cobrapy/optlang have no such
  requirement, so a reversible reaction here gets one indicator ``y`` and
  two constraints (``v <= M*y`` and ``v >= -M*y``), bounding ``|v|`` directly.
  At a cardinality-optimal solution the two are equivalent: MATLAB's MILP
  would never pay for two indicators on one reaction when zeroing the
  smaller direction and keeping the net flux is strictly cheaper.
- **Big-M from the model's own bounds, not a preliminary pFBA solve.**
  ``getMinNrFluxes.m`` first solves the model's *existing* objective to
  optimality, pins it, and minimizes the sum of fluxes subject to that pin —
  purely to estimate a safe big-M scale and a MILP warm start. That
  preliminary solve can fail (and therefore report "no feasible solution")
  even when the actual cardinality MILP below it — which never references
  the objective at all — is perfectly feasible on its own. This port
  estimates big-M directly from the reactions' own finite bounds instead
  (``5 * the largest finite |bound|``, floored at 1000, matching MATLAB's
  own floor), so it cannot fail for a reason unrelated to whether a minimal
  solution actually exists. No MILP warm start is set; a warm start only
  speeds up a solve that would otherwise still reach the same optimum.

    active:
        Ids from ``to_minimize`` whose indicator was on in the solution.

    """Find a flux distribution activating as few reactions as possible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model:
        Model to solve on, subject to its own steady-state constraints and
        reaction bounds as given (the model's ``objective`` plays no role;
        constrain it yourself first — e.g. pin it near its optimum — if a
        minimal solution *among optimal ones* is wanted).
    to_minimize:
        Reaction ids to give a binary "is this active" indicator. Defaults
        to every reaction in the model.
    scores:
        Per-reaction weights, same length and order as ``to_minimize``.
        Negative scores discourage that reaction from being active (more
        negative = more discouraged); non-negative entries are clamped up to
        the largest (least negative) negative score present, matching
        MATLAB's "positive scores are not possible" rule — or to 0 if
        ``scores`` has no negative entries at all (MATLAB has a latent bug
        here: ``max([])`` on an all-non-negative input silently *shrinks*
        the array via ``x(mask)=[]``, misaligning it with ``to_minimize``
        two lines later; this port treats "nothing to clamp to" as "clamp to
        0" instead). Defaults to an implicit -1 for every reaction (plain
        unweighted cardinality minimization).
    big_m:
        Override the big-M constant. Defaults to an estimate from the
        model's own bounds (see module docstring).
