"""Check whether a model performs a set of metabolic tasks.

For each task the model is constrained by the task's allowed inputs/outputs (and any
extra reactions / bound changes), then tested for feasibility: a task *passes* if a
steady-state flux exists, unless it is marked ``should_fail`` (then it passes iff
infeasible).

Inputs/outputs are encoded as ranges on the per-metabolite mass-balance constraint
(``model.constraints[met.id]``): an input allows net consumption (``Sv ∈ [-UB, -LB]``)
and an output allows / requires net production (``Sv ≤ UB``, and ``≥ LB`` if
``LB > 0``). By default, existing boundary reactions are left exactly as they are: a
task's inputs/outputs *add to* whatever the model's own open exchanges already allow,
rather than replacing them (RAVEN's ``checkTasks`` semantics, and what the published
task lists this module reads were curated against). Pass ``close_boundaries=True`` for
the stricter reading, where a task's declared inputs/outputs are the complete boundary
of the system for that check.
