"""Apply a curator's firm compartment decision and repair the model to keep it consistent.

:func:`relocate_reactions` takes a curated map ``{reaction_id: compartment}`` — the curator asserting
"this reaction belongs *here*" — and produces a new :class:`~raven_toolbox.localization.AssignmentProposal`
that honours those pins **and makes the consequential changes** needed for the new localisation to work:

* **gene consistency** — an enzyme localises to one compartment, so other reactions fully explained by
  the moved genes are co-moved with it (reported, and disableable);
* **transports added** — a moved reaction's metabolites are bridged into/out of the new compartment
  where they now must cross a membrane;
* **transports removed** — transports that only served the reaction's *old* compartment and are now
  orphaned (no reaction touches that species there any more) are dropped;
* **re-certification** — the repaired model is materialised and its growth checked, so a decision that
  breaks functionality is reported rather than silently shipped.

The transport repair is deliberately **surgical**: only species touched by the moved reactions are
reconsidered, so the diff is attributable to the curator's edit and unrelated placements are never
churned (unlike a full re-solve). It reuses :func:`assign_compartments`'s materialisation and the same
star-topology hub, so the result feeds straight back into :func:`apply_assignment`.
