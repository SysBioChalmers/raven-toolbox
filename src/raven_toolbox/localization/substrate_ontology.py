"""ChEBI-ontology substrate matching — the substrate-specific layer of evidence-aware transport scoring.

Two curated raven-data artefacts underlie this (built by ``scripts/build_transporter_data.py``):

* ``tcdb_substrates.tsv`` — TCDB's curated ``TC-ID -> substrate ChEBI(s)`` table;
* ``chebi_relations.tsv.gz`` — the ChEBI ``is_a`` graph plus the protonation/tautomer bridges.

Together they let a model metabolite's ChEBI be matched to the *specific* substrate a transporter is
curated to carry — a graded, distance-decayed refinement of the coarse family→class match. A metabolite
that **is** the curated substrate scores 1.0; a near subtype or protonation/tautomer variant scores a
little less; a far, generic relative (everything is eventually ``is_a`` "organic anion") falls outside
the hop budget and scores 0, so the coarse class layer takes over. This lifts *recall* — it evidences
metabolites the name-keyword classifier (:func:`~.transport_evidence.default_substrate_of`) misses —
without the coarse layer's promiscuity.
