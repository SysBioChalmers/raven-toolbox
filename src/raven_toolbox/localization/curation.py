"""Curation-priority scoring: which compartment assignments / transports to review by hand.

:func:`curation_priority` attaches a 0-1 "please-check-me" score to every reaction placement and every
added transport in an :class:`~raven_toolbox.localization.AssignmentProposal`, so a curator can sort
thousands of calls and review only the highest-value few percent. It is a post-processor — no new solve
except an optional gated essentiality FBA — combining several cheap signals that each flag a *distinct*
way a placement can be wrong. See ``docs/studies/curation_priority_signals.md`` for the full catalogue;
this ships the recommended first composite:

* **override** — the reaction was placed *against* its gene's top DeepLoc compartment, and that top
  compartment is not among the reaction's placements (functionality overrode confident evidence — the
  method's headline risk). Graded by ``score(top) - score(assigned)``, robust to organelle
  sub-compartment splits (e.g. mito matrix vs membrane) that a naive top1-top2 margin would mask;
* **sandwich** — the reaction's substrates are imported *into* its compartment and its products
  exported *out*, so it may belong in the neighbouring compartment (the seed motif). Graded by
  ``min(fraction of substrates imported, fraction of products exported)`` so a pure pass-through scores
  high and an incidental single shared transport scores low;
* **no_evidence** — no scored gene; compartment chosen by connectivity alone;
* **neighbour_outlier** — most of the reaction's metabolic neighbours sit in a *different* compartment
  (needs >=3 neighbours; ramped from a bare majority so a 51 % split is not treated like a 100 % one);
* **gapfill** — a reaction pulled from the universal model (inherently uncertain);
* **impermeant** (transports) — a transport of a species cells cannot freely move across a membrane:
  CoA-thioesters, acyl-ACP, tRNA-bound cargo, and free dinucleotide/flavin cofactors (NAD(P)(H),
  FAD/FMN) that in reality require a shuttle;
* **essential** (gated) — removing the reaction drops the *materialised* model's growth to near zero,
  *amplifying* an already-uncertain call.

Signals combine by **noisy-OR** so corroboration ranks a doubly-flagged call above either alone, with
essentiality as a multiplicative high-stakes gate. Currency metabolites (ATP/NAD(P)H/H+/H2O/CoA/Pi/...)
are excluded from the topology signals — without that the sandwich signal fires on nearly everything.
Currency/cofactor matching normalises the metabolite base key (strips an ``M_`` prefix and a bracketed
``[compartment]`` tag) so the exclusion also holds on id-keyed models, not only clean-name ones.

The two **topology** signals (sandwich, neighbour_outlier) are additionally multiplied by evidence
*weakness* ``1 - support(assigned)``: in this assignment method, importing substrates and exporting
products is the *normal* consequence of moving a reaction into an organelle, so those motifs describe
most placements and carry information only when the placement is *also* evidentially unsupported. This
gate is what makes the ranking selective (on genome-scale yeast it takes the flagged set from ~70 % of
reactions to ~20 %, with a clean separable top few percent) — surfacing placements that are both
structurally anomalous and unsupported by localisation evidence, which is the actual signature of a
questionable call. ``override`` is already evidence-based; ``no_evidence``/``gapfill``/``impermeant``
are independent of it.

    Parameters mirror :func:`assign_compartments` where they overlap (``model`` is the draft
    that was placed; pass the same ``base_metabolite``/``universal``). Returns a
    :class:`pandas.DataFrame` sorted by ``priority`` (descending), one row per *(reaction, compartment)*
    placement and per flagged added transport, with columns ``target`` (id), ``type``
    (``"placement"``/``"gapfill"``/``"transport"``), ``compartment``, ``priority`` (0-1), ``flags`` (the
    firing signal names, strongest first), ``action`` (the concrete thing to check), ``n_affected`` and
    ``affected``. Dual-localised reactions yield one row per compartment. Surface the top few percent.

    ``n_affected``/``affected`` give the **one-hop coupling** of each row — the other placed reactions
    that curating this one would touch, because they share a non-currency metabolite with it at the same
    compartment (for a placement) or depend on the transported species at either end of the bridge (for
    a transport). ``n_affected`` is the full count (sort by it to find high-impact curations that
    warrant care or a batched review); ``affected`` lists up to a dozen ids, the ones also flagged in
    this table first. The coupling is not transitive — each coupled reaction has its own blast radius.

    ``check_essential`` runs a single-reaction-deletion essentiality check (an FBA per candidate) on the
    already-flagged placements only (base priority ``>= essential_candidate_threshold``) and multiplies
    their score by ``1 + 0.6`` when removing them drops the *materialised* model's growth to near zero.
    Essentiality is measured against the applied model's own achievable growth, not the assignment's
    heuristic growth floor, and is skipped entirely if the materialised model cannot beat that floor
    (where the test could not discriminate) — pass ``min_growth`` to override the floor used for this
    comparison (default: the proposal's own floor). Set ``check_essential=False`` to skip the only
    non-cheap signal.

    ``currency_metabolites`` extends the built-in currency/cofactor set (ATP, NAD(P)H, H+, H2O, CoA, Pi,
    ...) that is excluded from the topology signals — pass ids or names for any organism-specific pool
    that should also count as freely available.

    A reaction whose ``localization`` confidence has been marked ``curated`` (via
