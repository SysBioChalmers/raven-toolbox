"""Compartment assignment: flux-free score placement + materialised-FBA certification.

:func:`assign_compartments` places reactions into subcellular compartments from soft
``gene x compartment`` localisation scores while keeping the result functional — and it does so
**without ever putting a flux model inside the placement optimisation**. A legacy approach that
coupled placement to a fused flux model could, at genome scale, certify a placement the materialised
model cannot actually grow (its tolerance-rounded gating binaries leak flux); keeping the flux model
out of the optimisation entirely removes that failure mode at the source:

1. a **flux-free placement master** (maximise localisation score, mono-localisation) — sound *by
   construction*: with no flux variable and no growth constraint, a tolerance-rounded binary has
   nothing to leak into, so the leak is unrepresentable by construction;
2. a **structural confinement repair** — reactions sharing a non-transportable metabolite are
   co-located (or pinned to a fixed reaction's compartment), and transportable pools a placement
   splits get star-topology transports;
3. **materialised-FBA certification** — the placement is confirmed functional by a real ``cobra`` FBA
   on the model :func:`apply_assignment` actually builds, over the primary medium and every
   :class:`GrowthCondition`. The certificate *is* the acceptance test, so the two can never disagree;
4. **feedback on real failure** — optional gap-fill from a ``universal`` model, then (for a genuine
   placement gap) a tightening of placement, re-solving until certified or the round budget is hit.

The returned :class:`AssignmentProposal` is marked ``certified=True`` **iff** the materialised model
reaches the growth floor on every medium; otherwise it is returned ``certified=False`` with the
failing media in :attr:`AssignmentProposal.growths`. There is no optimistic certificate — a placement
that cannot grow is never reported as if it could.

See ``docs/studies/localization_redesign.md`` for the design rationale.

    """Assign ``reactions_to_relocate`` to compartments, certifying functionality with a real FBA.

    Placement is decided by a flux-free score MILP, and functionality is a separate,
    materialised-FBA-verified repair (see the module docstring and
    ``docs/studies/localization_redesign.md``). Notable parameters:

    ``transport_cost``
        Accepted for signature compatibility but **not used**: the placement master is flux-free and
        score-only, and ``minimize_transports`` prunes transports by flux (pFBA), not by cost.
    ``max_rounds``
        Budget on placement-tightening rounds (confinement repair + growth-failure feedback). The
        common genome-scale case (everything transportable) certifies in one round.
    ``prune_transports``
        Drop transports blocked in every certification medium (sound; on by default).
    ``minimize_transports``
        After certifying, prune the transport (and gap-fill) set to the reactions that carry flux in a
        **parsimonious FBA** solution (:func:`_minimize_transports`). Sound by construction (a zero-flux
        reaction can be removed without changing the solution) and fast (one LP-scale pFBA), it gives a
        large honest reduction (yeast-GEM: ~1260 -> ~280 transports) while staying certified — re-checked
        against every medium, falling back to the un-minimised set if a growth-condition need was pruned,
        so it is never non-functional. Off by default (adds one pFBA + re-certification).
    multi_localize:
        After certifying, add sound **multi-compartment** placements (:func:`_enrich_multilocalization`):
        propose, per reaction, a second compartment its gene has DeepLoc evidence for (score
        ``>= multi_localize_threshold``), materialise all candidates, and keep only those a single
        **loopless FVA** shows can carry flux ``>= multi_localize_eps`` in a biomass-supporting solution.
        Keeping the placement master mono-localised (tractable at genome scale) and gating each second
        compartment with one loopless FVA is what makes multi-localisation scale: an FVA that a dead
        duplicate cannot pass does the soundness check no in-MILP activity binary could afford at this
        size. Off by default (adds one FVA).

        **Caveat (over-inclusive).** The gate — DeepLoc score above threshold *and* able to carry flux
        — is *sound* (no dead duplicate survives) but not *precise*: many reactions can carry some flux
        in a second compartment without being biologically dual, so at genome scale a large fraction is
        multi-placed (yeast-GEM: ~700 of ~2300 at the default threshold). It recovers the
        DeepLoc-visible dual enzymes (e.g. HTS1/VAS1/GLR1) but not those dual by post-translational
        retro-translocation (FUM1, ACO1), whose second compartment carries no DeepLoc signal — catching
        those needs a functionality-driven candidate source (a metabolite required in the second
        compartment), which is future work. Treat this as a scalable, sound *lower bound* on
        multi-localisation, not a precise dual-localisation caller.
    multi_localize_threshold:
        DeepLoc score a gene needs in a second compartment for that placement to be *proposed*
        (default ``0.7``). Higher = fewer, more confident duplicates, but too high loses genuine duals
        (yeast-GEM: 0.9 drops HTS1/VAS1/GLR1; 0.7 keeps them).
    multi_localize_eps:
        Flux magnitude a proposed duplicate must reach in the FVA to be *kept* (default ``1e-6``).
    multi_localize_loopless:
        Use loopless FVA (default ``True``) so a duplicate active only in a futile cycle is not kept —
        closing the internal-cycle caveat of the old in-MILP mode. Set ``False`` for a faster,
        cycle-permissive check.
