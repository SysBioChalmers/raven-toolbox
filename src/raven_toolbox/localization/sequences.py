"""Prepare input for sequence-based localisation predictors (DeepLoc 2.1, MULocDeep, …).

These predictors take protein sequences in **FASTA** and emit a per-protein localisation table you
then load with :func:`load_deeploc` / :func:`load_mulocdeep`. This module fetches protein sequences
for a model's genes from UniProtKB and writes a FASTA whose headers are the model's **gene ids**, so
the predictor's output lines up with the model — and with the loaders here — directly:

    fetch + write FASTA ─▶ run DeepLoc 2.1 (you) ─▶ load_deeploc(output) ─▶ predict_localization

**There is no public batch API for DeepLoc 2.1.** Run it yourself on the FASTA this writes, either on
the web server (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/DeepLoc-2.1/, **max 500 sequences per
submission** — :func:`prepare_deeploc_input` chunks for you) or with the downloadable standalone
(no per-submission limit). DeepLoc requires sequences of **≥ 10 amino acids**.

Sequences come from UniProtKB by the same identifier the localisation loaders key on
(``gene_oln`` = the ORF / ordered-locus name like ``YNR001C`` for yeast-GEM). Genes with no reviewed
UniProt entry are reported back to you rather than silently dropped.
