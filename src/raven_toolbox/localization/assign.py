"""Shared data structures and materialisation for compartment assignment.

This module holds the pieces the compartment-assignment method builds on, independent of how
placement is decided:

* :class:`AssignmentProposal` — the outcome of an assignment (per-reaction / per-gene compartments,
  added transports and gap-fill reactions, and a growth certificate);
* :class:`GrowthCondition` — a soft multi-medium growth requirement;
* :func:`apply_assignment` — materialise a proposal into a compartmentalised :class:`cobra.Model`
  (a deep copy): move reactions to their compartments, duplicate them for multi-localisation, add the
  star-topology transports, and pull in any gap-fill reactions.

Placement itself is decided by :func:`raven_toolbox.localization.assign_compartments`, whose acceptance
test is a real FBA on the materialised model — so :func:`apply_assignment` (the materialised model) is
authoritative for functionality. Localisation
evidence is an agnostic ``gene x compartment`` score table
(:class:`raven_toolbox.localization.scores.LocalizationScores`) — any predictor or database.

Built on raven-toolbox + cobra.

    :func:`assign_compartments` materialises the placement and confirms it reaches
    ``min_growth`` by a real FBA not only on the primary medium but on each ``GrowthCondition`` medium
    too — so a transport or placement has to serve **every** condition that needs it, which keeps
    alternative-carbon-source pathways (respiration, β-oxidation, the glyoxylate cycle, ...) genuinely
    connected rather than stranded in flux-dead islands that single-medium growth cannot see.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name:
        Short label for the condition, used in the per-condition growth report. Distinct per condition.
    medium:
        ``exchange_reaction_id -> max uptake (>= 0)``. Exchanges not listed are closed for uptake,
        so ``medium`` fully specifies the environment (carbon source *and* supplements).
    min_growth:
        Biomass floor this condition must reach on the materialised model.

    Attributes
    ----------
    placements:
        ``reaction_id -> [compartments]`` the reaction is assigned to (one or more).
    gene_compartments:
        ``gene_id -> [compartments]``.
    added_transports:
        ``(base_metabolite_id, compartment)`` pairs needing a transport to/from
        ``default_compartment``.
    added_reactions:
        ids of gap-fill reactions pulled from the ``universal`` model to keep the
        compartmentalised network functional.
    unplaced_reactions:
        relocate-set reactions with no scored gene support (placed by function only).
    objective:
        placement-master objective (localisation score − transport − multi-penalty − gap-fill cost).
    min_growth:
        the growth floor enforced.
    status:
        solver status (``"optimal"``, ``"infeasible"``, ...) plus ``"certified"`` / ``"uncertified"``
        — the placement's functionality was (or was not) confirmed by a real FBA on the materialised
        model.
    certified:
        ``True`` iff ``apply_assignment`` + FBA reaches the growth floor on **every** medium.
    growths:
        set by :func:`assign_compartments`: the materialised biomass flux per medium
        (``"__primary__"`` plus each :class:`GrowthCondition` name), so the caller can see *how far*
        an uncertified placement fell short without re-running FBA.
