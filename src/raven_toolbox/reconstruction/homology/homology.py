"""Build a draft model from template models + homology hits.

Key behaviour:

* clear ``bidirectional`` / ``best_hits_only`` parameters control the hit-filtering
  strictness (cleaner than a single overloaded "strictness" knob);
* GPR rewriting works on cobra's AST, not regex;
* explicit ``complex_policy`` decides what happens to AND-subunits that lack an

* best-hit selection is bitscore-based;
* the ortholog map is a DataFrame; provenance is structured.

    ``strictness`` (1/2/3) is a legacy alias for ``bidirectional`` / ``best_hits_only``.

    Other parameters that materially change the result:

    * ``bidirectional`` (default True) requires a reciprocal hit — a template
      gene and a new-organism gene must each be the other's best match —
      rather than trusting a hit in just one direction.
    * ``best_hits_only`` (default False) keeps only each gene's single best
      hit (ranked by ``score``) instead of every hit that passes the filters.
    * ``map_direction`` picks which one-directional search to trust when
      ``bidirectional`` is False: ``"new_to_old"`` (default, hits found
      searching from ``model_for``) or ``"old_to_new"``.
    * ``score`` is the metric used to rank hits for ``best_hits_only``:
      ``"bitscore"`` (default) or ``"evalue"``.
    * ``complex_policy`` decides what happens to an AND-linked subunit with no
      ortholog: ``"flag"`` (default) keeps the reaction with a placeholder
      gene for later curator review, ``"keep"`` drops just that subunit,
      ``"drop"`` drops the whole reaction.
    * ``only_genes_in_models`` restricts the hits table to genes that actually
      appear in the given ``models`` before mapping orthologs.
    * ``preferred_order`` breaks ties when more than one template maps the
      same new-organism gene: the earlier template in the list wins that gene
      (default: the order of ``models``).

    Defaults for the three filters come from
    :doc:`a calibration against KEGG orthology </studies/homology_cutoff_calibration>`,
    scored with precision weighted above recall (a wrongly transferred reaction
    is harder to undo than a missing one):

    * ``min_identity`` 40 is the binding filter and the measured optimum.
    * ``min_align_len`` 100 replaces RAVEN's 200, which discarded real orthologs
      for no gain in precision. Anything at or below 150 measured the same; 200
      cost 1-2 points on every organism tested.
    * ``max_evalue`` makes no difference anywhere between 1e-4 and 1e-50 -- the
      other two filters have already excluded whatever it would exclude -- so
      1e-30 is kept for continuity with RAVEN rather than for any measured effect.

    ``review_identity`` (e.g. 25) collects what those thresholds turn away. Any
    reaction that *would* have transferred at the looser identity is reported in
    ``HomologyResult.candidates`` with its strongest supporting hit, and is not
    added to the model. The two error types are not symmetric -- a missing
    reaction can be gap-filled, a wrong one is hard to find and harder to remove
    -- so the filters stay strict, but the evidence for the near misses is handed
    to the curator instead of being discarded silently.
