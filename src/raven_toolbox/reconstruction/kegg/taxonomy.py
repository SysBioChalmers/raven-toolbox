"""Parse the KEGG ``taxonomy`` file into lineages, domains, and phylogenetic distances.

Ports RAVEN ``getPhylDist``: the file-reading half (per-organism category lineages and
the domain split) **and** the distance-matrix half (:func:`phyl_dist`), which earlier
ports deferred. The ``taxonomy`` file is an indented tree: ``#``-prefixed lines name a
category, the number of leading ``#`` giving its depth; organism lines are tab-separated
``T-number<tab>org_id<tab>T-number<tab>name``. Each organism inherits the stack of
categories above it, the first of which is its domain (``Prokaryotes`` / ``Eukaryotes``).

Used by 3b.3 to split genes into the prok/euk HMM libraries, by 3b.4 domain mode, and by
:func:`phyl_dist` to regenerate the KEGG phylogenetic distance matrix (RAVEN's
``keggPhylDist``) that GECKO uses to pick the closest organism for kcat assignment — so
that capability needs no MATLAB ``.mat`` file, only the published ``taxonomy`` artefact.
