"""Per-reaction, multi-facet confidence — persisted in the model, ignored by plain cobra.

Attaches a small structured record to a reaction scoring how well-supported each *facet* of it is:
``localization``, ``equation`` and ``gene_association``. Each facet is a :class:`ConfidenceEntry` — a
continuous 0-1 ``score`` plus optional provenance (a categorical ``level``, the ``basis`` evidence,
``method``/``source``/``note``). A reaction carries a :class:`ReactionConfidence` (facet → entry) whose
``overall`` is the weakest facet.

**Two rules govern every score**, because ``overall = min(facets)`` and :func:`_write` drops the record
when no facet remains:

1. **Abstain rather than guess.** A facet that *does not apply* to a reaction is not written at all — an
   absent facet is neutral under ``min``, whereas ``1.0`` would claim the reaction was checked and
   passed. An exchange reaction is imbalanced by construction; it gets no ``equation`` facet, not a
   perfect one. Use :func:`equation_exempt` / :func:`gene_association_exempt` to ask why.
2. **A zero is a measurement, never ignorance.** ``score == 0.0`` means evidence *contradicts* the model
   (a proven mass imbalance; zero localisation support at the assigned compartment). Where the evidence
   is merely missing or uninterpretable, the score is low but positive. Hence the invariant enforced in
   the tests: ``max(defect scores) < min(ignorance scores)`` across all facets, so a reaction with a
   proven defect always outranks one that is merely unverifiable.

**Storage.** The record lives as one JSON blob under ``reaction.notes["raven_confidence"]``. cobra
round-trips ``notes`` losslessly through YAML/JSON and, as an HTML-escaped string, through SBML; the
helpers here write ``json.dumps`` and read ``json.loads(html.unescape(...))``, so the same code works for
either format. Plain cobra ignores the key entirely — a confidence-annotated model still loads and
solves unchanged (a test invariant).

**SBO precondition.** The exemptions read ``reaction.annotation["sbo"]``. On a model carrying no reaction
SBO terms the scorers warn, because they cannot then tell a biomass pseudo-reaction from a chemistry
defect. Detecting biomass by name instead is deliberately *not* done: ``\\bgrowth\\b`` matches
"non-growth associated maintenance reaction", and a name regex must never silence a chemistry check.

The design and the measured yeast-GEM distributions are in ``docs/studies/confidence_tracking.md``; the
facet set above is closed. Wire it in by calling :func:`score_localization_confidence` on an
:class:`~raven_toolbox.localization.AssignmentProposal`, :func:`score_equation_confidence` and
:func:`score_gene_association_confidence` on any model, and :func:`mark_curated` when a curator firmly
fixes a facet (e.g. after :func:`~raven_toolbox.localization.relocate_reactions`).
