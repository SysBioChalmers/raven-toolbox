"""LP-based gap-filling: fastGapFill and swiftGapFill.

For each blocked draft reaction, solves a single LP that identifies the
minimum-L1-flux (fastLP) or maximum-non-core-flux (swiftLP) extension of
the merged draft+template model that activates the blocked reaction. The
union of all template reactions activated across all LP solves is returned.

* **fastLP** minimises the sum of |template fluxes| while forcing the
  blocked reaction to carry >= epsilon flux (FASTCORE, Vlassis 2014).
* **swiftLP** maximises the sum of template fluxes in a single LP solve
  per blocked reaction (SWIFTCORE, Tefagh & Boyd 2020). Because the
  maximisation objective is degenerate, results can differ between runs
  or solvers.

Unlike :func:`~raven_toolbox.gapfilling.fill.connect_blocked_reactions`,
this is LP-only (no MILP), so it scales better to large models. However,
the returned template set is a union over individual LP solutions and may
be larger than strictly necessary.

Metabolite identifiers in *templates* must match those in *model* (matched
by reaction id via :func:`~raven_toolbox.manipulation.transfer.add_reactions_from_model`).

    epsilon:
        Minimum flux threshold for a reaction to be considered active.

    n_proc:
        Worker processes for solving each blocked reaction's LP in parallel.
        Defaults to ``cobra.Configuration().processes``; set to 1 to solve
        serially in this process. Each blocked reaction's LP only depends on
