"""Read and write RAVEN/cobrapy YAML models.

Aligned to RAVEN ``writeYAMLmodel.m`` / ``readYAMLmodel.m`` as of the
``feat/geckopy-compat-yaml`` work (commit fa281a1), whose writer emits **cobra's
native ``!!omap`` YAML**. Because the format *is* cobra's, the standard model
content — id, name, compartments, and per-entry id/name/compartment/formula/
charge/bounds/gene_reaction_rule/objective_coefficient/subsystem/metabolites and
the whole ``annotation`` block (which carries ``smiles`` for metabolites,
``ec-code`` for reactions, and all MIRIAM cross-references) — is read and written
by ``cobra.io`` directly.

This module only handles what cobra drops or mishandles:

* **RAVEN-only top-level per-entry keys** that cobra ignores: ``inchis``,
  ``deltaG``, ``metFrom`` and the free-text ``notes`` (metNotes) on metabolites;
  ``confidence_score``, ``references``, ``rxnFrom``, ``deltaG`` and ``notes``
  (rxnNotes) on reactions; ``protein`` on genes. These are stashed in the cobra
  object's ``.notes`` dict on read and lifted back to top-level keys on write.
* **Model-level extras** cobra ignores: ``version`` and the ``metaData``
  provenance block, preserved on ``model.notes`` for round-tripping.
* **The GECKO ec sections** (``ec-rxns``/``ec-enzymes``/``gecko_light``): on
  read, parsed into a typed :class:`~raven_toolbox.io.ec_data.EcData` and
  attached as ``model.ec``; on write, serialised back to top-level sections
  whenever ``model.ec`` is present. This mirrors RAVEN ``readYAMLmodel.m`` /
  ``writeYAMLmodel.m``, which populate the ``model.ec`` struct when the YAML
  defines it. Any other unknown top-level keys are still preserved opaquely
  via ``model.notes['_yaml_sections']``.

Legacy quirks the reader also accepts (silent normalisation):

* older RAVEN files with ``id`` / ``name`` nested in ``metaData``;
* per-metabolite top-level ``smiles`` (lifted into ``annotation['smiles']``);
* per-reaction top-level ``eccodes`` (lifted into ``annotation['ec-code']`` —
  the cobra-standard place where geckopy reads EC numbers);
* very old RAVEN files written as a bare ``-`` sequence of single-key mappings
  rather than one big mapping;
* MATLAB GECKO ecModels whose ``usage_prot_*`` and ``prot_pool_exchange``
  reactions use the older reverse-direction convention (negative lower bound,
  swapped stoichiometry signs); these are flipped on load so consumers always
  see the forward convention.
