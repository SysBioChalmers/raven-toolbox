"""The ftINIT MILP — the faster staged variant of INIT.

ftINIT keeps tINIT's objective — pick the reaction subset best matching expression
scores while staying flux-consistent — but with a cheaper MILP encoding that is the
reason it is *fast*: a **positive-score reaction needs no binary**. Because the
objective *maximises* ``Σ score·y`` with ``score > 0``, the optimiser pushes its
continuous indicator ``y ∈ [0,1]`` to 1, and the gate ``net_flux ≥ force_on·y`` only
lets ``y`` reach 1 if the reaction can actually carry flux. Only *negative*-score
reactions need a true ``{0,1}`` binary (their indicator would otherwise sit at 0 for
free). This roughly halves the integer count — the dominant MILP cost.

Reaction categories (RAVEN's six), by score sign × reversibility:

* **score 0** — left in the model, *not* in the problem: a free flux variable that can
  carry flux for connectivity but is neither scored nor removable.
* **positive, irreversible** — continuous ``y∈[0,1]``; ``v ≥ force_on·y``. No binary.
* **positive, reversible** — split ``v = v⁺ − v⁻``; continuous ``y``; a single
  direction binary keeps one of ``v⁺/v⁻`` at 0 (no fwd/back loop faking "on");
  ``v⁺+v⁻ ≥ force_on·y``.
* **negative, irreversible** — binary ``x∈{0,1}``; ``v ≤ ub·x``.
* **negative, reversible** — split; binary ``x``; ``v⁺+v⁻ ≤ cap·x``.
* **essential** — forced on (``v ≥ force_on_ess``); no indicator. Assumed already
  oriented irreversible in its forced direction (``prepINITModel`` does this).

Objective: **maximise** ``Σ score·indicator``. Unlike classic INIT
(:func:`raven_toolbox.init.run_init`), ftINIT does **not** reward production of every
metabolite — ``prod_weight`` applies only to metabolomics-detected metabolites (not
yet implemented; passing a non-empty ``metabolomics`` argument raises
``NotImplementedError``). Connectivity comes solely from the flux gates plus any
essential reactions. ``allow_excretion`` relaxes ``S·v = 0`` to ``≥ 0``; ``rem_pos_rev``
drops positive reversible reactions from the problem (used in the staging schedule).

Needs a MILP solver (cobra's configured optlang solver; only Gurobi is fully viable at
genome scale — see the `INIT solver benchmark
<https://github.com/edkerk/raven-docs/blob/main/docs/parameter-tuning/studies/init-solver-benchmark.md>`_
on raven-docs). Magic numbers (``force_on``/``force_on_ess`` = 0.1, ``big_m`` = 100) are
exposed and scale-dependent; calibration tables are in the `INIT parameter calibration
study
<https://github.com/edkerk/raven-docs/blob/main/docs/parameter-tuning/studies/init-param-calibration.md>`_
on raven-docs. ``big_m`` caps a *scored*
reaction's flux in its on/off (direction) constraint — using a fixed 100 rather than
the reaction's ±1000 bound keeps the LP relaxation tight (what makes the genome-scale
MILP tractable). Free / essential reactions keep their real bounds.

⚠️ **Loops.** The MILP has *no* loopless constraint: an internal
thermodynamically-infeasible cycle is flux-consistent (``S·v = 0``), so if its
reactions carry positive net score the optimiser will "include" them with no real
exchange flux. RAVEN tolerates this — loop-free models come from the staged pipeline
+ exchange handling, and at genome scale real exchange reactions make such cycles not
score-optimal. A loopless option could be layered on later if needed.

    """Run the single-step ftINIT MILP and return the extracted model.

    ``rxn_scores`` maps reaction id → score (default 0 → reaction left free in the
    model, not scored or removable). ``essential_rxns`` are forced to carry flux
    (≥ ``force_on_ess``, overridable per reaction via ``essential_force``);
    ``essential_directions`` maps an essential reaction id to ``+1`` (forward) or
    ``-1`` (reverse) for the forced direction (default forward). ``ignore_mets`` are
    metabolite **names** whose mass balance is dropped (RAVEN's per-step "simple
    metabolite" removal, e.g. H2O/H+). See the module docstring for the formulation.
    This is the single-step variant; the staged schedule
    (:func:`raven_toolbox.init.ftinit`) calls it per step.

    ``mip_gap`` / ``time_limit``: the default ``None`` uses the solver's own
    defaults (Gurobi: MIPGap≈1e-4, no time cap), which is fine for a single step
    — solve time here is dominated by model construction, so a tight gap is
    nearly free (measured on genome-scale Human-GEM, see the `INIT parameter
    calibration study
    <https://github.com/edkerk/raven-docs/blob/main/docs/parameter-tuning/studies/init-param-calibration.md>`_
    on raven-docs). For the genome-scale staged
    schedule (:func:`raven_toolbox.init.ftinit`), an essential-forced step can
    run away without a cap (one severely-degraded case ran >75 min unbounded);
    set ``time_limit`` ≈120-600 s/step, and loosen ``mip_gap`` to ``0.01`` (or
    ``0.005``) for a ~37% speedup at ≥0.99 Jaccard vs. the tight-gap model.

    ``prove_abs_gap``, when set, proves the solve to this fixed absolute objective
    gap instead of a relative ``mip_gap``/``mip_gap_abs`` — see the ``prove_abs_gap``
    parameter of :func:`ftinit` for when to use it (recommended value: ``1.0``).

    ``resolve_ties`` (opt-in, default off to preserve RAVEN parity) resolves the MILP's
    degeneracy deterministically: after the score optimum is found, a lexicographic
    phase 2 holds the objective and minimises the id-ordered count of "on" reactions, so
    the kept set is the sparsest optimum found, independent of solver seed/version,
    instead of an arbitrary tie-break. At genome scale the phase-2 solves themselves can
    exhaust ``time_limit``; when that happens the (still-adopted) incumbent is an
    unproven tie-break and a warning is raised. See :func:`_resolve_ties`.

    ``reference_reactions`` (requires ``resolve_ties=True``) is a set of reaction ids —
    this model's own ids, e.g. the ``kept_reactions`` of a prior :class:`FtInitResult` on
    the same model — that a *reference* build kept. When given, it becomes the first
    tie-break criterion, ahead of parsimony/id-rank: among the score-optimal solutions,
    prefer the one whose removable-reaction decisions match the reference most closely.
    This targets *stability*, not determinism — see :func:`ftinit`'s
    ``reference_reactions`` for the intended use (comparing two similar inputs, or a
    template before/after a small edit) and its own caveats.

    ``seed`` is Gurobi's ``Seed`` parameter (RAVEN's 1234). The MILP is degenerate, so the
    seed picks which of many equal-score optima the solver returns; varying it is the cheap
    way to probe how much of a result rests on the tie-break rather than on the data.

    ``threads`` is Gurobi's ``Threads`` (RAVEN's 1). Raising it speeds the solve but
    **forfeits reproducibility**: multi-threaded Gurobi races between equal optima, so two
    runs of the same input can return different reaction sets. Left at 1 unless a caller
    knowingly trades determinism for speed. Measured to have no effect on the *swing*
    between different seeds (raising it is not a substitute for ``resolve_ties``) — see the
    `ftINIT reproducibility study
    <https://github.com/edkerk/raven-docs/blob/main/docs/parameter-tuning/studies/ftinit-determinism.md>`_

    """Pin ftINIT's degenerate optimum to a single, reproducible solution (on ``opt``).

    The ftINIT MILP is highly degenerate: many reaction subsets reach the same score
    optimum and the solver returns an arbitrary one — reproducible for a fixed solver
    build + seed, but fragile to the Gurobi version or platform (a changed tie-break
    moves ~1-2% of the kept reactions, which flips a handful of gene-essentiality calls).

    This runs a lexicographic phase 2, holding the score objective at its optimum with a
    floor constraint: first minimise the count of kept removable reactions (the sparsest
    optimum), then, among the sparsest, minimise their summed id rank (prefer lower ids).
    The result is a stable, near-unique optimum independent of seed/solver version *when
    both phases converge* — see the caveat below. ``opt`` is left holding the phase-2
    solution, which the caller reads for the "on" set and fluxes; the reported objective
    stays the phase-1 ``primary`` value.

    Only the negative-score reactions carry a true 0/1 "keep" binary (the positive
    indicators are continuous and pinned near 1 by the score objective), so the two phases
    run over those: their count and id-sum are integers, provable with a cheap absolute gap
    below 1 rather than the near-full proof a tiny relative gap would need. This resolves
    the removable-reaction choices — the genuine seed-fragile degeneracy; a residual
    flux-distribution degeneracy (which only feeds the next step's small ``ess_force``
    clamp) is left to the solver.

    Caveat, measured on genome-scale Human-GEM (not visible at toy/unit-test scale, where
    both phases prove in milliseconds): the phases can themselves exhaust ``time_limit``,
    in which case the incumbent adopted is an *unproven* tie-break — it still measurably
    reduces the run-to-run spread relative to no tie-break at all, but it is no longer a
    guarantee. A warning is raised when this happens; see the `ftINIT reproducibility
    study
    <https://github.com/edkerk/raven-docs/blob/main/docs/parameter-tuning/studies/ftinit-determinism.md>`_
    on raven-docs.

    ``reference`` (opt-in, requires no change to the phases above when omitted) adds a
    phase *before* parsimony: minimise the count of binaries whose keep/drop decision
    disagrees with ``reference`` (a set of reaction ids this build should try to match).
    This re-orders the lexicographic cascade to (score) → (match reference) → (parsimony)
    → (id-rank), so among the score-optimal solutions the one closest to the reference is
    preferred over the sparsest one. This is the tool for *stability* — keeping a
    re-extraction close to a previous build, or two comparable inputs close to each other
    — as opposed to plain determinism, which ``resolve_ties`` alone already provides.
    Reaction ids not present in ``indicators`` (essential, free, or absent from this
    template) are silently ignored, so ``reference`` can safely be a full reaction-id set
    from an unrelated model.

    Returns ``True`` if phase 2 produced a usable solution (the caller then reads the
    resolved "on" set and fluxes), ``False`` if it did not converge to an incumbent (the
    caller keeps the phase-1 optimum). Best-effort: it never fails the extraction.

    ``prep`` is a :class:`raven_toolbox.init.PrepData`. ``rxn_scores`` maps **original**
    reaction id → score (e.g. from :func:`score_reactions_from_genes` on the template).
    ``series`` selects which staged schedule to run — see :func:`get_init_steps` for
    what each option changes (default ``'1+1'``); pass ``steps`` directly to use a
    custom schedule instead. Each step regroups scores under its ``ignore_mask``, fixes
    the reactions turned on by earlier steps as essential (in their flux direction), and
    solves :func:`run_ftinit` on the merged model. Reactions never turned on (and not
    essential or left-in) are removed from the reference model; exchange reactions are
    always kept (RAVEN re-adds them).

    If ``fill_gaps`` and ``prep`` carries tasks, reactions are added back so every task
    is feasible (:func:`raven_toolbox.init.fill_tasks`). If ``gene_scores`` is given,
    negative-scoring genes are pruned from the GPRs at the end
    (:func:`raven_toolbox.init.remove_low_score_genes`).

    Essential reactions are forced to carry ``force_on`` (default 0.1) of flux in the
    forced direction. On genome-scale models a stricter regime is needed (the previous
    step's actual carried flux instead of a flat 0.1) — exposed via per-reaction
    ``essential_force`` on :func:`run_ftinit`.

    ``metabolomics`` (a list of detected metabolite names to reward producing) is
    **not yet implemented**: the linear merge eliminates degree-2 detected metabolites,
    so it needs a producer-group-mapping + negative-producer force-flux block — the
    most intricate MILP piece, for the least-used input. Passing a non-empty value
    raises ``NotImplementedError``.

    ``mip_gap``/``time_limit`` are forwarded to each :func:`run_ftinit` solve. On
    genome-scale models they are essential for tractability — see the `INIT parameter
    calibration study
    <https://github.com/edkerk/raven-docs/blob/main/docs/parameter-tuning/studies/init-param-calibration.md>`_
    on raven-docs for the calibration table.

    ``resolve_ties`` and ``prove_abs_gap`` (both opt-in, default off → exact RAVEN
    behaviour) reduce the arbitrariness of the degenerate MILP's tie-break, yielding a more
    parsimonious and more *reproducible* extracted model. They do **not** make the model
    biologically more accurate: the alternative optima they choose among are equally
    consistent with the expression data, so this only pins *which* optimum is returned. It
    reduces the fragility of the MILP, not its correctness:

      * ``resolve_ties`` adds a lexicographic phase 2 that selects the sparsest (then
        lowest-id) optimum, so the degenerate choice is pinned rather than left to the
        solver — applied both to each extraction step and to the task gap-fill.
      * ``prove_abs_gap`` replaces the loose relative-gap escalation with a single solve per
        step proven to this fixed *absolute* gap, so the kept-set objective is optimal at
        any scale — not an arbitrary within-gap incumbent. **Try 1.0**: on Human-GEM/DLD1
        the escalation returns a solution 2.0 below the optimum at the first stage and 4.0
        below at the second (351 kept reactions instead of 349), while every value in
        1.0-2.0 proves the true optimum at ~2.4x the runtime. Tighter values are
        counter-productive — 0.5 and below stop being provable within the time limit and
        return the same model anyway.

    ``seed`` (RAVEN's 1234) and ``threads`` (RAVEN's 1) are forwarded to every step; see
    :func:`run_ftinit` for what they trade off. Neither flag makes the extraction *stable*
    under small input changes, which is a separate property — see the `ftINIT
    reproducibility study
    <https://github.com/edkerk/raven-docs/blob/main/docs/parameter-tuning/studies/ftinit-determinism.md>`_
    on raven-docs. Measured there on Human-GEM/DLD1: ``resolve_ties`` makes repeated builds
    at a fixed seed identical and halves the seed-to-seed spread in predicted essential
    genes (16 → 8 flips); its own tie-break phases can exhaust ``time_limit`` at genome
    scale, in which case it reduces rather than eliminates that spread and raises a
    warning. Baseline and ``resolve_ties`` on identical inputs already differ by ~10% of
    essential-gene calls, both fully score-optimal — when comparing models before and
    after a curation, apply the edit to the extracted model as a control, not only to the
    template.

    ``reference_reactions`` (requires ``resolve_ties=True``) targets that gap directly: a
    set of **original** ``prep.ref_model`` reaction ids that a reference build kept (e.g.
    ``{r.id for r in reference_model.reactions}``). When given, each step's tie-break
    prefers the reaction subset that most closely matches the reference, ahead of
    parsimony/id-rank — so a re-extraction of a lightly edited template, or of a
    comparable-but-distinct sample, stays close to the reference wherever the data does
    not force a difference, instead of the MILP re-selecting from scratch. Translated
    once (via ``prep.group_of``) into every step's merged-reaction id space, so it is
    safe to pass the reactions of a model built from a *different* (e.g. edited) prep, as
    long as it shares this prep's underlying template — ids absent from this prep are
    silently ignored. The same set (untranslated — gap-fill candidates are already
    ``ref_model`` ids) also anchors the task gap-fill, when ``fill_gaps`` is on — see
    :func:`raven_toolbox.init.fill_tasks`'s own ``reference_reactions``.

    This can only ever resolve a genuine tie, never suppress a real difference: the
    reference-matching phase runs *after* the primary score objective is fixed at its own
    optimum for *this* sample's own data (a floor constraint, same mechanism ``resolve_ties``
    already uses), so a reaction the data genuinely prefers is already locked in before the
    reference is ever consulted. This does not eliminate re-selection drift, only reduces
    it — see the raven-docs reproducibility study for measurements once available.
