"""Linear reaction merging for ftINIT.

ftINIT shrinks the MILP losslessly by **contracting linear reaction chains**: a
metabolite that appears in exactly two reactions (one net producer, one net consumer)
links them into a single combined reaction. Iterating this collapses unbranched
pathways — on Human-GEM ~12k → ~8k reactions, a ~⅓ smaller MILP — without changing
the feasible flux space. Reversible reactions may merge too (unlike
``simplifyModel``'s merge), which is why ftINIT ships its own.

:func:`merge_linear` returns the reduced model plus the bookkeeping needed to map
scores and results back to the original reactions:

* ``group_ids`` — one integer per original reaction; ``0`` = not merged, equal
  non-zero integers = merged into the same combined reaction (which keeps one
  member's id).
* ``reversed_rxns`` — which originals were flipped (their stored direction negated)
  when oriented for merging; needed to map fluxes/directions back.

:func:`group_rxn_scores` then sums the original per-reaction scores over each group,
with RAVEN's zero-handling (see its docstring): genuine 0 → 0.01, ignore-masked → 0,
a group cancelling to 0 with non-zero members → 0.01 — all so the MILP never sees an
exactly-zero score (whose on/off would be arbitrary).

    Each pass recomputes the metabolite→reaction incidence fresh, then merges over the
    degree-2 metabolites found at the start of the pass. A metabolite that only
    *becomes* degree-2 mid-pass (because one of its reactions was just merged into a
    survivor) is therefore picked up on the next pass rather than immediately — linear
    merging is confluent, so the final grouping is the same regardless, it just takes a
    few extra passes on long chains. (RAVEN re-finds incidence per metabolite and so
    finishes a chain in one pass; the end result is equivalent.)
