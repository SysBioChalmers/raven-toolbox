"""Remove metabolites or genes from a model.

For removing *reactions*, use cobra directly:
``cobra.Model.remove_reactions(reactions, remove_orphans=...)``.

The two functions here delegate the core to cobra and add the cobra-absent behaviour:

* ``remove_metabolites`` — cobra matches metabolites by ID; RAVEN's ``isNames``
  deletes a metabolite in **every compartment at once** by name. That name
  resolution is the *sole* reason this wrapper exists (see the note on it).
* ``remove_genes`` — cobra's ``cobra.manipulation.remove_genes`` already rewrites
  GPRs through the boolean AST (removing one gene of ``A and B`` empties the
  rule, of ``A or B`` keeps the other) — exactly RAVEN's intent, without its
  ``eval``. The gap is RAVEN's default of **constraining** flux-blocked reactions
  to zero instead of deleting them; exposed as ``blocked_reactions``.

    ----------
    by_name
        If True, ``metabolites`` are metabolite *names*; every metabolite with a

    destructive
        Passed to cobra: if True, also remove every reaction the metabolite
        participates in.

    Note
    ----
    With ``by_name=False`` this is just ``model.remove_metabolites`` — the
