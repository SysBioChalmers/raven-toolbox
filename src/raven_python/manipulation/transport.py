"""Add transport reactions between compartments.

cobra has no transport-reaction primitive. For each metabolite this matches the
species by *name* across compartments (the source in ``from_compartment`` and its
same-named twin in each target compartment), optionally creating the target
metabolite, and
builds a ``-1 from / +1 to`` reaction with a sequential ``tr_0001`` ID.

    ----------

        Target compartment id(s).
    metabolite_names
        Names of metabolites to transport. Default: every metabolite in

    reversible
        If True (default), bounds span the cobra configuration default
        (reversible); otherwise lower bound 0.
    only_to_existing
        If True (default), only transport a metabolite into a target
        compartment where a same-named metabolite already exists. If False,
        create the missing target metabolite (copying name/formula/charge/
        annotation from the source) before adding the transport.

        Prefix for the sequential reaction IDs (``tr_0001``, ...).
