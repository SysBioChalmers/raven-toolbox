"""Change the stoichiometry of existing reactions from equation strings.

Editing the same ``Reaction`` object changes only its stoichiometry — its id, name,
bounds, GPR, subsystem, and position are preserved automatically by cobra.

So this port simply re-parses the equation (reusing the same metabolite
matching as :func:`~raven_python.manipulation.add.add_reactions_from_equations`,
including name and ``name[comp]`` modes that cobra lacks) and swaps the
metabolites in place.

Like RAVEN, **bounds are left unchanged** even if the new equation's arrow
implies a different reversibility — use a bounds setter for that.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Target ``cobra.Model``, mutated in place.
    equations
        Mapping of ``reaction_id -> equation string``. Every ID must already
