"""Expand reactions with isozymes into one reaction per isozyme.

Operates on cobra's GPR AST, so the model stays a plain ``cobra.Model`` throughout.

Provenance: this implementation was first written for geckopy
(``geckopy/ec_model/pipeline/expand.py``, where it backed makeEcModel stage 5)
and is adopted here as its canonical home; geckopy will import it from raven_python
once raven_python is published.

MATLAB-COMPAT: GECKO MATLAB and RAVEN ``expandModel.m`` use string manipulation
on grRules to detect and split isozymes. raven_python uses cobrapy's GPR AST
instead. Output should be equivalent for any well-formed GPR; cases that differ
are likely malformed GPR strings that the AST flags as invalid.
