"""Copy reactions (with their metabolites and genes) from another model.

cobra's ``Model.merge`` / ``add_reactions`` match metabolites strictly by id. This
transfers a chosen set of reactions from a *source* model into a draft, matching
metabolites by **name[compartment]** instead — so a compound present in both models
under different ids is reused rather than duplicated, and only genuinely new
metabolites are created (copying the source's id, formula,
charge, and annotation). New genes are auto-created by cobra when the GPR is set.
This is the post-``getModelFromHomology`` "copy a few more reactions across"
workflow.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Draft model to copy into (mutated in place).
    source_model
        Model to copy reactions from.
    reactions
        Reaction ID(s) in ``source_model``. Reactions already present in
        ``model`` (by ID) are skipped.
    genes
        ``False`` (default): add reactions without GPRs. ``True``: copy each
        reaction's GPR from the source. A string: use it as the GPR for every
        added reaction. A list: per-reaction GPRs (matching the reactions that
        are actually added). New genes are created automatically.
    note
        Stored in each added reaction's ``notes['note']`` (set ``None`` to skip).
    confidence
        If given, stored in each added reaction's ``notes['confidence_score']``.

    Returns
    -------
    list of cobra.Reaction
        The reactions added, in input order.
