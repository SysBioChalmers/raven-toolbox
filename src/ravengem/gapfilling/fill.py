"""Connectivity gap-filling: add the fewest template reactions so reactions that are
*blocked* in a draft can carry flux.

For the other gap-filling flavour (add the fewest template reactions until the model's
own objective becomes feasible) use ``cobra.flux_analysis.gapfill`` — just align the
template's metabolite ids to the draft first, since cobra matches by id.

It solves an MILP: pick the minimum-penalty subset of template reactions such that the
blocked (irreversible) draft reactions can carry flux at steady state. Template
metabolites are matched to the draft by ``name[compartment]`` (via
:func:`add_reactions_from_model`), so templates in a different identifier namespace
than the model still work. Per-reaction ``scores`` (higher = prefer to include) map to
RAVEN's ``rxnScores``; the MILP minimises the penalty ``-score`` (default penalty
``1.0``, i.e. minimise the number of reactions added).
