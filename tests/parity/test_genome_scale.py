"""Tier 2 at genome scale: the extraction the studies report, re-run nightly.

The Human-GEM, yeast and multi-organism validations in ``docs/studies/`` are the
strongest evidence raven-toolbox agrees with MATLAB RAVEN, and they are also the
least protected: they were measured once, by hand, on a model too large for a
free runner's solver licence. Nothing re-checks them.

These tests close that gap on a licensed runner (see
``.github/workflows/parity-nightly.yml``). They need a genome-scale model, given
by ``$HUMAN_GEM_YML``, and a Gurobi licence that will accept it -- the
size-limited licence bundled with pip-installed gurobipy will not.

Unlike the small fixture, this is where an overlap *band* is the honest
assertion rather than exact equality: at this size the MILP has many optima of
equal value, and a bounded solve (``time_limit``, ``mip_gap``) may legitimately
stop at a different one. The band floor is recorded in the baseline alongside
the run that produced it, so it can be tightened as evidence accumulates rather
than guessed now.
