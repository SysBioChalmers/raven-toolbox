# Cross-language parity checks

These tests answer one question: **does raven-toolbox still agree with MATLAB
RAVEN?** Until now that agreement was reported in study documents and nothing
would fail if it stopped being true.

Run them with:

```bash
pytest -m parity
```

They are marked so the default suite stays fast and self-contained; nothing here
is required for raven-toolbox to be correct on its own terms.

## What "agree" means

"Identical output" is achievable for some functions and meaningless for others,
so the checks are written in three tiers. Putting a function in the wrong tier
produces either a flaky test or a vacuous one.

### Tier 1 — exact

Deterministic transformations of a model or a file: I/O round-trips, task-list
parsing, gene-association normalisation, elemental balance, identifier sorting,
model merging, reversibility splitting, KEGG table parsing. Values must match.
A disagreement means one implementation is wrong.

Note that *exact* means semantically exact, not byte-identical. RAVEN and
raven-toolbox both write valid YAML but differ in key order and quoting style,
which carries no meaning; comparing bytes would test the serialiser's habits
rather than the model.

### Tier 2 — set-level

Mixed-integer results: INIT/ftINIT extraction, gap-filling, compartment
assignment. These problems have many optima of equal objective value, so a
different answer is not a wrong answer. What can be checked is *drift*: today's
result against the result that was last inspected and accepted.

`test_set_level.py` does that against a baseline recorded by
`scripts/parity/record_baseline.py`. When a change is expected to move the
extraction, read the diff the failure prints, re-record, and say in the pull
request why it moved:

```bash
python scripts/parity/record_baseline.py    # uses $RAVEN_ROOT
```

That baseline asserts **exact** set equality rather than an overlap band,
because it was measured rather than assumed: on this fixture GLPK and Gurobi
return the same 13 reactions, and each is identical across repeated runs. A
difference therefore means this package changed, not that the solver picked
another optimum. On a fixture where the solvers genuinely disagree, the honest
form is a band with a measured floor — not a loosened threshold on this one.

The baseline is seeded from raven-toolbox itself, which makes it a regression
guard rather than a cross-language check. Its `source` field records that, and
the test prints it on failure so the two are not confused. Extending
`generate_oracles.m` with an extraction oracle turns the same comparison into a
real parity check.

### Tier 3 — statistical

Flux and random sampling. Two runs of the *same* implementation differ. Compare
distributions at a fixed seed, never individual samples.

## Where the reference values come from

Two sources, with different trade-offs:

1. **RAVEN's own artefacts** (`test_yaml_interop.py`). RAVEN's repository
   contains models written by MATLAB RAVEN itself. Reading them with
   raven-toolbox is a genuine cross-language check that needs no MATLAB
   installation — but it does need a RAVEN checkout, so these tests skip unless
   `RAVEN_ROOT` points at one:

   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 -b develop3 https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN
   RAVEN_ROOT=$PWD/RAVEN pytest -m parity
   ```

   RAVEN is GPL and raven-toolbox is MIT, so those files are **read where they
   are** and never copied into this repository.

2. **Recorded oracles** (`test_oracles.py`). For behaviour that cannot be
   inferred from a file — what `checkTasks` reports, how `getElementalBalance`
   grades a reaction — MATLAB has to be run once and its answers recorded.
   `scripts/parity/generate_oracles.m` does that, reading the fixtures in
   `tests/data/parity/` (authored here, so no GPL material is involved) and
   writing JSON into `tests/data/parity/oracles/`. Those tests skip when the
   oracle file is absent, so a checkout without them still passes.

   To regenerate, in MATLAB with RAVEN on the path:

   ```matlab
   cd scripts/parity
   generate_oracles
   ```

   Commit the resulting JSON, and note the RAVEN commit it came from in
   `oracles/PROVENANCE.md`.

## Determinism

`test_determinism.py` is not cross-language: it checks that raven-toolbox gives
the *same* answer twice — including in a second process. Python randomises
string hashing per process, so a set iterated to build constraint rows gives a
stable answer within one run and a different one in the next; repeating the call
in-process cannot see that, so one test runs the computation under three
`PYTHONHASHSEED` values through `_hashseed_worker.py` and compares digests.
(That is what `scripts/determinism_probe.py` did by hand while the placement
determinism fixes were being made.)

It lives here because it protects the same property the parity tiers do — several recent fixes made compartment placement and gap-filling
deterministic, and nothing would have caught a regression.

## What is enforced today

- Every RAVEN-authored model loads and round-trips without losing RAVEN's own
  fields (tier 1).
- The small-model extraction has not drifted from its recorded baseline
  (tier 2).
- The deterministic paths return the same answer twice.

Still only *reported*, not enforced: the genome-scale Human-GEM, yeast and
multi-organism comparisons in `docs/studies/`. They need Gurobi and models too
large for a free runner, so closing that gap needs a nightly job on a licensed
runner — the next piece of this harness. Tier 3 has a stated contract and no
tests yet for the same reason.
