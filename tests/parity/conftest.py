"""Fixtures for the cross-language parity checks.

Everything here skips rather than fails when its reference material is absent:
a checkout without a RAVEN clone, or without regenerated oracles, still has a
green suite. What must never happen is a parity test that silently passes
because it compared nothing -- so each fixture skips with a message naming
exactly what is missing and how to supply it.
