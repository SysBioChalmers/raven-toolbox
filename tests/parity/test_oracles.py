"""Tier 1: compare against answers recorded from MATLAB RAVEN.

Some behaviour cannot be inferred from a file -- how RAVEN grades a reaction's
elemental balance, what it normalises a gene rule to. For those, MATLAB is run
once by ``scripts/parity/generate_oracles.m`` and its answers are committed as
JSON; these tests assert raven-toolbox agrees.

Each test skips, with instructions, when its oracle has not been generated, so
a checkout without oracles still has a green suite. The trade-off is deliberate:
a skipped test is visible in the report, a fabricated oracle is not.
