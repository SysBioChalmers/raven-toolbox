"""The same input must give the same answer twice.

Not a cross-language check, but it protects the property the parity tiers rest
on: a comparison against MATLAB means nothing if raven-toolbox itself returns a
different model each run.

Compartment placement and gap-filling were made deterministic in #76, #83 and
the assignment gap-fill rework, all without a regression test -- the property
was verified once, by hand, and nothing has guarded it since. Tie-breaking in a
MILP is easy to reintroduce accidentally (an unordered set, a dict iteration
order, an unseeded solver), and the symptom is a benchmark that quietly moves.
