"""Comparison 1 — can our approach replicate curated yeast-GEM's compartmentalisation?

A controlled, same-content test that calls **only the shipped public API** — no benchmark-specific
draft construction, annotation wrappers, or metric reimplementations:

1. `manipulation.merge_compartments` flattens curated yeast-GEM to a single compartment (holding the
   reaction/gene content exactly fixed; `base_metabolite=lambda m: m.name` because yeast-GEM keys the
   same species to a different `s_####` id per compartment).
2. `load_deeploc` (+ `DEFAULT_COMPARTMENT_MAP`) reads the committed yeast DeepLoc predictions;
   `annotate_proteome` annotates the yeast proteome's transporters; `evidence_aware_transport_cost`
   turns both into the per-metabolite `transport_cost` mapping.
3. `assign_compartments` re-places every internal reaction on that flattened draft; `apply_assignment`
   materialises the result.
4. The recovered compartmentalisation is scored against curated yeast-GEM: reaction- and gene-level
   compartment agreement, added-transport count, growth, and — crucially — **functional connectivity**
   via cobra's own `find_blocked_reactions` (what fraction of re-placed reactions can actually carry
   flux, so a placement that looks right but strands the reaction in a disconnected compartment is
   counted honestly, not hidden behind a positive growth number).

Curated yeast-GEM distinguishes membrane sub-compartments (erm/mm/vm/gm) that DeepLoc does not, so for a
fair head-to-head the curated truth is collapsed onto its parent organelle (the granularity the scores
can express) before agreement is measured.
